Welcome :handshake: to my Github profile, I've been expecting you stop by someday, and you did. Isn't that amazing? Hopefully, we'll have some fun projects to work on; I'm earnestly and eagerly looking forward to it!

Currently I work as a software developer and database administrator at the Distance Learning Center (DLC), University of Ibadan, Nigeria.
I'm taking an adventure into the amazing world of **Data science** and **Machine Learning**, You can find some projects I have completed on my pinned repos.

I'm excitedly looking forward to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learning related projects with you, and I'm open to working remotely.
